ASN.1-Decoder
=============

A web page to decode any BER encoded data and display it nice and clearly to the user
Most of the ASN.1 parsing action is done with the [PHPASN1](https://github.com/FGrosse/PHPASN1) framework so you might check it out.

There is also a [live web demo](http://corvespace.de/asn1/) available.
